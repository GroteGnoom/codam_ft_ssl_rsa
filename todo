https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem) list of 5 steps
step 1: 2 prime numbers p and q (with lots of demands)
step 2: n = p*q
step 3: Carmichael's totient (位) of n = lcm(p - 1, q - 1).. but you can also use Euler's totient instead!
step 4: e, which is coprime with 位, usually 65537. which is just prime. largest Fermat number, called F4. So not really a step, it's just 65537
step 5: d = e^-1 (mod 位), so the modular multiplicative inverse of e , so de = 1 (mod 位)
